# Analysis of Psychoactive Substance Use

This project aims to create a decision-making system that analyzes data on the use of psychoactive substances based on demographic factors such as age, gender, wealth status, etc. It utilizes data from the [SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration), which includes various psychoactive substances and their effects on different social groups.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizing SAMHSA datasets to analyze trends in psychoactive substance use.
- **Decision Modeling**: Implementation of a simple decision model to predict the likelihood of substance use based on demographic variables.
- **Visualization**: Graphical presentation of analysis results, enabling an understanding of how different factors influence substance use.
- **Interactivity**: Ability to interact with the data and models to explore various scenarios.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model implementation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Installed packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
